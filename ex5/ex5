1. XSS possibility on contacts edit page: user can input JavaScript code as Notes, such as xxxx <script>for (i=0;i<5;i++){var x="this is " + i ;alert(x);}</script> , which cause 5 times alert box display. 
This security hole will allow attacker make visitors' page to do anything JavaScript code can do.

2. Insufficient Authorization: security hole on user see their friends shared contacts page, which allow one user to see other user's contacts without permission, just direct through URL like http://cmpt470.csil.sfu.ca/security/friends/user4/ (assume user 4 does not share contacts to current user).
This security hole will cause user's private information leakage.

3. Inappropriately-trusted input: if user only type space in the first name and the last name input boxes, when add a new person's contact, the AttributeError page will be given.
This inappropriate input dose not be limited, which cause attribute error.

4. Iappropriately-trusted input: when user edits contacts, if user change the first name and last name to white space, the name of this contact will be empty. 
When user finish editing and back to home page, he/she cannot access this contact anymore because there is no link for it.

5. general deficiency: if user4 has already shared contacts whit user1, user2, user3, and click link "Share my contacts with a friend" again, user4 cannot back to home page. Because there are no more person can be submit and no link for home page.
